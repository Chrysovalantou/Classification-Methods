Implementation of two classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes

Supervised machine learning is the search for algorithms that reason from externally supplied instances
to produce general hypotheses, which then make predictions about future instances. In other words,
the goal of supervised learning is to build a concise model of the distribution of class labels in terms
of predictor features. 
The resulting classifier is then used to assign class labels to the testing instances
where the values of the predictor features are known, but the value of the class label is unknown.

In this repository you can find the implementation from scratch, in Python, of two classifiers:
k-Nearest Neighbors and Naive Bayes.
The two classifiers were tested in real data. During training, k-fold stratified cross validation was used, also 
implemented here.


This work has been done as part of the class "Methods in Bioinformatics" during my M.Sc. studies in Bioinformatics Graduate program, at the University of Crete, GR.
